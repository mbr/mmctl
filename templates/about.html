			<p>The first version of <strong>mmctl</strong> was written when I wanted to play a game with a friend and could not properly configure murmur fast enough. One hour later he had to leave and I had a new itch that needed scratching.</p>
			<p>mmctl is available on <a href="https://github.com/mbr/mmctl" title="mmctl's GitHub page">GitHub</a>. Feel free to send me feedback, suggestions, anything you can think of.</p>
			<p>Other than numerous jQuery plugins, mmctl uses <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Bootstrap, from Twitter">Bootstrap</a>, which I think is the best thing <a href="http://twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> has ever given me. The server-side uses <a href="http://python.org" title="Python programming language">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.zeroc.com/icepy.html" title="ZeroC Ice">ZeroC's Ice</a> and the irresistable <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" title="The best web framework for python out there">Flask</a>.
